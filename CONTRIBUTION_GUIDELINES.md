# Paper Plane is an Open Source Project

## You Should Know

- To contribute with a small fix, simply create a pull request.
- Better to open an issue to discuss with the team and the community if you're intended to work on something BIG (Wellcome to join our Slack Group [Android Devs](https://androiddevsslack.slack.com/), email me first and then I will invite you as soon as possible).
+ Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
+ Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
+ Titles should be capitalized.
+ Keep descriptions short and simple.
+ End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
+ Check your spelling and grammar.
+ Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
+ Try to make your Pull request and title as descriptive as possible.
- Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/gejiaheng/Protein/wiki/Roadmap) to see more information about this project.
- Better to use English to open issues and pull requests.

## Code Style
